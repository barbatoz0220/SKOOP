# SKOOP
Introduction: This is a game project made for OOP Lab Class on Monday afternoons by HCMIU students. These are the names and student's IDs of the 4 members who contributed in developing the game during the project:
1. Lê Thị Tường Vi - ITITIU18145
2. Lê Hoàng Đăng Khoa - ITITIU18063
3. Lê Phan Anh - ITITIU18208
4. Phạm Hoàng Nam Anh - ITITIU18007

Descriptions: You will enter the game as a hero on your journey to fight against monsters that live in a dungeon. Your goal is to defeat as many of these monsters as possible and your score will be calculated based on the kill count and the time it took for you to do so.

Movements: Move around with W A S D buttons. Attack with J button.

Developers' notes: We started this project under the instructions of a Youtuber's guide on Java Game Programming. Here is the link to the very playlist that helped us reach this far: https://youtu.be/hM4pN7hAsgg . However, the above playlist is not a complete one and our team has done our best to improvise and thus we have managed to add a few additional features to the game to make it what it is today.
All the resources that we used for the game are all free to use and we did not make the game out of our own financial interests. Much of them you can find along with the source code that the Youtuber has added in his videos's descriptions. 

Thank you very much for choosing to play our game.
